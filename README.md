# ECG XML Project

## 🩺 Project Overview
This is a Python-based data analysis project using XML conversion and statistical techniques to analyze frequency-domain ECG data from PhysioNet's ECG Fragment Database for exploring dangerous arrhythmias. This project demonstrates basic **XML data handling** and **data analysis skills** using ECG data. It was developed to clearly showcase data analysis capabilities, XML conversion skills, and clinical data mapping knowledge, developed for my personal learning purpose. It uses ECG fragment data from PhysioNet.

## 🎯 Purpose
- Learn XML from scratch
- Convert clinical ECG data from CSV to XML
- Analyze and extract meaningful clinical insights from XML data
- Clearly demonstrate skills in healthcare data analysis and XML handling

## 📂 Project Structure
ECG_XML_Project/ ├── data/ # Original ECG CSV data ├── xml_output/ # XML converted files ├── analyze_xml.py # XML data analysis script ├── csv_to_xml.py # CSV-to-XML conversion script └── xml_analysis_results_detailed.csv # Analysis results (avg, min, max amplitude)


## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas library
- XML (xml.etree.ElementTree)
- Git/GitHub for version control

## 📚 **Project Description**
This project involved converting ECG frequency-domain data from CSV files into structured XML format, followed by statistical analysis using Python. The analysis calculates:

- **Average amplitude** (general signal strength overview)
- **Minimum amplitude** (lowest frequency amplitude, indicating possible noise or signal loss)
- **Maximum amplitude** (highest frequency amplitude, potentially indicating abnormal events)

These parameters help clinical specialists quickly identify patterns associated with cardiac events such as dangerous arrhythmias.

## 🩺 **Healthcare Data Mapping**
Although this project currently uses a custom XML structure, it demonstrates how clinical ECG data can be structured clearly. Future work could map this data explicitly to standardized healthcare interoperability protocols like HL7 or FHIR, ensuring compatibility across various medical information systems.

## 🚀 **Getting Started**
Follow these clear steps to run this project locally:

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```shell
git clone <https://github.com/kiranpok/ECG_XML_Project.git>
cd ECG_XML_Project
```

###**Step 2: Install Dependencies**
```shell
pip install pandas
```

### **Step 3: Convert CSV to XML**
```shell
py csv_to_xml.py
```

### **Step 4: Run XML Data Analysis**
```shell
py analyze_xml.py
```

### Results will appear as:

xml_analysis_results_detailed.csv


## 🚀 Future Improvements
Integration with healthcare interoperability standards (e.g., HL7, FHIR)
Development of automated workflows for continuous data processing
Advanced visualization tools for clinical decision-making support
